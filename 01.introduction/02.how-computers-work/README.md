# How Computers Work on Electricity

- **Power Supply**: Converts electrical energy from an outlet into usable power for the computer components.
- **Transistors**: Act as electronic switches that control the flow of electricity, forming the basis of logic gates and circuits.
- **Logic Gates**: Perform basic operations (AND, OR, NOT) using electrical signals to process binary data (0s and 1s).
- **Data Representation**: Information is represented in binary form, where electrical signals indicate high (1) or low (0) states.
- **Signal Processing**: Electrical signals are processed by the CPU to execute instructions and perform calculations.
- **Communication**: Data is transmitted between components (CPU, RAM, storage) using electrical signals over buses.
- **Cooling**: Electrical components generate heat, requiring cooling systems (fans, heat sinks) to maintain optimal operating temperatures.
