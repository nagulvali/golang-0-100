# GoLang
- An open-source programming language supported by Google
- Invented by
  - Ken Thompson
    - Solely respinsible for designing and implementing the original Unix operating system
    - Co-creator of the B programming language, a precursor to C
  - Rob Pike
    - Unix
    - UTF-8
  - Robert Griesemer
    - Studied under Alan Kay, the pioneer of object-oriented programming
- First released in 2009
- Easy to learn and great for teams
- Built-in concurrency and a robust standard library
- Statically typed and compiled language
- Designed for simplicity, efficiency, and reliability

## Concurrency vs Parallelism
- Concurrency is the design pattern where programs are structured to handle multiple tasks at once, potentially interleaving their execution.
- Parallelism is the actual execution of multiple tasks simultaneously, often on multiple processors or cores.
- Go natively supports concurrency through goroutines and channels, making it easier to write concurrent programs.

## Use Cases:
- Cloud & Network services
- Command line interfaces
- Web development
- Devops & Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)


## Why Go Invented?
> [Go at google](https://go.dev/doc/faq#why_go)
- At Google, they were facing challenges with existing programming languages in terms of compilation speed, dependency management, and ease of use for large-scale software development.
- They wanted a language that could handle the demands of modern software development, including concurrency and scalability.
- Go was designed to be simple, efficient, and productive, addressing these challenges while maintaining performance and reliability.
- Go was created to improve developer productivity and address the shortcomings of existing languages in large-scale software development.
- Key Goals:
  - Efficient compilation
  - Efficient Execution
  - Ease of programming
