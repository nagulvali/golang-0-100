# Go Variables
- A variable is a name for a memory location where a value of a specific type is stored
- In Go a variable belongs and it's created at run time.
- A declared variable must be used or we get an error !
- _ is the blank identifier and mutes the compile-time error returned by unused variables.

## Syntax

```go

var <name> <type> = <value>

var x int = 7
var name string = "vali"
```
