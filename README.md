- Remember that everyone starts somewhere, and it's okay to not know everything.
- Focus on continuous learning and improvement rather than comparing yourself to others.
- Celebrate your achievements, no matter how small they may seem.
- Seek support from peers, mentors, or online communities when you feel uncertain about your skills.
- Remember that even experienced developers were once beginners.

### Help each other
- Join Go communities and forums to connect with other developers.
- Share your knowledge and experiences to help others learn and grow.
- Collaborate on projects to gain practical experience and build your portfolio.
- Participate in code reviews to learn from others and improve your coding skills.
